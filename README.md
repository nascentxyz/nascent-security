# Simple Security Toolkit
This repo is a collection of practical tips and resources developed by the Nascent team to share with our portfolio companies and others in the ecosystem who might find it useful. It is not intended to be comprehensive; it skews towards practical and opinionated recommendations that we find to be appropriate particularly to teams developing and managing early versions of a protocol.

### Contents

1. **[Development Process](https://github.com/nascentxyz/simple-security-toolkit/blob/main/development-process.md)**

One of the most crucial factors in having a secure codebase is a solid development process. "An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure". This document gives an example development process that we, at Nascent, have found works well. It walks through the steps from initial design and feature requests -> specification -> evaluation -> implementation -> testing -> deployment -> monitoring.

2. **[Audit Readiness Checklist](https://github.com/nascentxyz/simple-security-toolkit/blob/main/audit-readiness-checklist.md)**

Audits are expensive, time consuming, and need to be scheduled months in advance. Completing this checklist helps ensure a codebase is ready for outside review and helps catch as much low-hanging fruit as possible. This will allow the auditors to focus their time and attention on identifying deeper and more critical vulnerabilities.

3. **[Pre-Launch Security Checklist](https://github.com/nascentxyz/simple-security-toolkit/blob/main/pre-launch-security-checklist.md)**

Before deploying your code to mainnet, complete this checklist to make sure you have taken the necessary steps to enable reporting and responding to potential bug reports or security incidents.

4. **[Incident Response Plan Template](https://github.com/nascentxyz/simple-security-toolkit/blob/main/incident-response-plan-template.md)**

No project ever expects to have a security incident. Having a plan documented in advance can help your team respond swiftly and calmly in the heat of the moment when adrenaline is running high.
