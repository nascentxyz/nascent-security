# Simple Security Toolkit
This repo is a collection of practical tips and resources developed by the Nascent team to share with our portfolio companies and others in the ecosystem who might find it useful. It is not intended to be comprehensive; it skews towards practical and opinionated recommendations that we find to be appropriate particularly to teams developing and managing early versions of a protocol.



### Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing! We are *very* opinionated as to what gets added to this repository. However, we are open to outside contributors putting forth suggestions and encourage you to do so. If you have ideas for a new document, it is likely best to open an issue before starting on a PR to gauge our support. If you have suggestions to existing documents, you can open a PR right away.

Feel free to fork this repo and make it your own. Share your ideas with your team and iterate. If you find things that may be useful to a broader set of teams, consider opening a PR!
